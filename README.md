Demo: [https://anuragtomar2510-covid19-tracker.netlify.app/]

It is a React-based Covid-19 Tracking Application. It displays Covid-19 Global Stats like total number of confirmed cases, total number of active cases, total number of recovered cases and total deaths. Also, user can select a country to see Covid-19 Stats in that country. This application uses disease.sh - Open Disease Data API which can be found [here](https://corona.lmao.ninja/). It also uses [react-chartjs-2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2) for displaying Covid-19 Country Stats.
