# Covid-19 Tracker

This is a COVID-19 tracking application that provides a comprehensive overview of global statistics. Users can view key metrics, including the total number of confirmed cases, active cases, recoveries, and deaths. Additionally, users have the option to select a specific country to see detailed COVID-19 statistics for that region. The application utilizes the disease.sh Open Disease Data API, accessible [here](https://corona.lmao.ninja/), to ensure accurate and up-to-date information. To enhance data visualization, it incorporates [react-chartjs-2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2) for displaying country-specific stats. Stay informed and monitor the pandemicâ€™s impact with ease!
